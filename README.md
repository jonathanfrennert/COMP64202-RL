# COMP64202 Reinforcement Learning 2024/2025 - University of Manchester

**Course Lecturers**: [Wei Pan](https://panweihit.github.io) and [Mingfei Sun](https://mingfeisun.github.io/)

## Description

This is a CDT module offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester.

This course explores how agents learn to make decisions through interaction with an environment, guided by rewards. It covers fundamental tabular methods (MDPs, value functions, model-free RL), function approximation & deep RL (linear function approximation, LSTD, deep RL), policy gradients & model-based RL (actor-critic, natural gradients, model-based exploration), and POMDPs & multi-agent RL (belief MDPs, deep RL for POMDPs, cooperative multi-agent RL). The course combines theoretical insights with practical implementations using modern RL frameworks.

If you want to save changes to the Notebook, you need to save them before quitting. According to [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Rmai0dD30XzL):

If you would like to save your changes from within Colab, you can use the File menu to save the modified notebook either to Google Drive or back to GitHub. Choose File→Save a copy in Drive or File→Save a copy to GitHub and follow the resulting prompts. To save a Colab notebook to GitHub requires giving Colab permission to push the commit to your repository.
